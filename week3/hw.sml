(* 1. This problem involves using first-name substitutions to come up with alternate names. For example,
Fredrick William Smith could also be Fred William Smith or Freddie William Smith. Only part (d) is
specifically about this, but the other problems are helpful. *)

(* 1a. Write a function all_except_option, which takes a string and a string list. Return NONE if the
string is not in the list, else return SOME lst where lst is identical to the argument list except the string
is not in it. You may assume the string is in the list at most once. Use same_string, provided to you,
to compare strings. Sample solution is around 8 lines.*)

val all_except_option_test4 = all_except_option("a", ["a"]) = SOME []

(* 1b. Write a function get_substitutions1, which takes a string list list (a list of list of strings, the
substitutions) and a string s and returns a string list. The result has all the strings that are in
some list in substitutions that also has s, but s itself should not be in the result. Example:
get_substitutions1([["Fred","Fredrick"],["Elizabeth","Betty"],["Freddie","Fred","F"]],
"Fred")
(* answer: ["Fredrick","Freddie","F"] *)
Assume each list in substitutions has no repeats. The result will have repeats if s and another string are
both in more than one list in substitutions. Example:
get_substitutions1([["Fred","Fredrick"],["Jeff","Jeffrey"],["Geoff","Jeff","Jeffrey"]],
"Jeff")
(* answer: ["Jeffrey","Geoff","Jeffrey"] *)
Use part (a) and MLâ€™s list-append (@) but no other helper functions. Sample solution is around 6 lines. *)
